### üîß Technical Details

#### CompanyResource.php Changes Made:
```php
// Before (broken):
public static function form(Schema $schema): Schema
public static function table(Table $table): Table
protected static string | UnitEnum | null $navigationGroup = "Products";

// After (fixed):
public static function form(Form $form): Form
public static function table(Table $table): Table  
/** @var UnitEnum|string|null */
protected static $navigationGroup = "Products";
```

#### Form Schema Structure:
- Uses `Forms\Components\Section` for organization
- Proper field validation (required, email, url, etc.)
