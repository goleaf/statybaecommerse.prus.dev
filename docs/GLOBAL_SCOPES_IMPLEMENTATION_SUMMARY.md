# Global Scopes Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive implementation of Laravel Global Scopes following the Laravel News article pattern for query filtering across the e-commerce application.

## Implementation Details

### Global Scope Classes Created

#### 1. **ActiveScope** (`app/Models/Scopes/ActiveScope.php`)
- **Purpose**: Filters records where `is_active = true`, `is_enabled = true`, or `is_visible = true`
- **Applied to**: 18 models (Product, Category, Brand, Collection, News, Post, User, Discount, Coupon, FeatureFlag, Subscriber, Partner, Campaign, Attribute, Order, Channel, Zone)

#### 2. **PublishedScope** (`app/Models/Scopes/PublishedScope.php`)
- **Purpose**: Filters records where `published_at` is not null and is in the past
- **Applied to**: 3 models (Product, News, Post)

#### 3. **VisibleScope** (`app/Models/Scopes/VisibleScope.php`)
- **Purpose**: Filters records where `is_visible = true`
- **Applied to**: 5 models (Product, Category, Collection, News, Attribute)

#### 4. **EnabledScope** (`app/Models/Scopes/EnabledScope.php`)
- **Purpose**: Filters records where `is_enabled = true`
- **Applied to**: 9 models (Category, Brand, Discount, FeatureFlag, Partner, Campaign, Attribute, Channel, Zone)

#### 5. **ApprovedScope** (`app/Models/Scopes/ApprovedScope.php`)
- **Purpose**: Filters records where `is_approved = true`
- **Applied to**: 1 model (Review)

#### 6. **StatusScope** (`app/Models/Scopes/StatusScope.php`) - **NEW**
- **Purpose**: Filters records by status field with model-specific allowed statuses
- **Applied to**: 4 models (Order, Campaign, Channel, Zone)
- **Features**: 
  - Model-specific status filtering
  - Configurable allowed statuses per model
  - Smart status detection

#### 7. **ActiveCampaignScope** (`app/Models/Scopes/ActiveCampaignScope.php`) - **NEW**
- **Purpose**: Filters campaigns that are currently active based on start/end dates
- **Applied to**: 1 model (Campaign)
- **Features**:
  - Date range validation
  - Null-safe date handling
  - Real-time campaign filtering

### Models Enhanced with Global Scopes

#### Previously Implemented (12 models):
1. **Product**: ActiveScope, PublishedScope, VisibleScope
2. **Category**: ActiveScope, EnabledScope, VisibleScope
3. **Brand**: ActiveScope, EnabledScope
4. **Review**: ActiveScope, ApprovedScope
5. **Collection**: ActiveScope, VisibleScope
6. **News**: ActiveScope, PublishedScope, VisibleScope
7. **Post**: ActiveScope, PublishedScope
8. **User**: ActiveScope
9. **Discount**: ActiveScope, EnabledScope
10. **Coupon**: ActiveScope
11. **FeatureFlag**: ActiveScope, EnabledScope
12. **Subscriber**: ActiveScope

#### Newly Enhanced (6 models):
13. **Partner**: ActiveScope, EnabledScope
14. **Campaign**: ActiveScope, StatusScope, ActiveCampaignScope
15. **Attribute**: ActiveScope, EnabledScope, VisibleScope
16. **Order**: ActiveScope, StatusScope
17. **Channel**: ActiveScope, EnabledScope, StatusScope
18. **Zone**: ActiveScope, EnabledScope, StatusScope

### Implementation Pattern

All global scopes follow the Laravel 11 `ScopedBy` attribute pattern:

```php
#[ScopedBy([ActiveScope::class, PublishedScope::class, VisibleScope::class])]
final class Product extends Model
{
    // Model implementation
}
```

### Key Features

1. **Automatic Column Detection**: Scopes automatically detect which columns exist in the model's table
2. **Model-Specific Logic**: StatusScope provides different allowed statuses per model
3. **Date-Based Filtering**: ActiveCampaignScope handles complex date range logic
4. **Bypass Capability**: All scopes can be bypassed when needed
5. **Performance Optimized**: Efficient query building with proper indexing support

### Testing

#### Test Files Created:
1. **`tests/Feature/GlobalScopesTest.php`** - Original comprehensive test suite (12 test methods)
2. **`tests/Feature/AdditionalGlobalScopesTest.php`** - New test suite for additional scopes (10 test methods)

#### Test Coverage:
- ✅ Basic scope functionality
- ✅ Scope bypassing
- ✅ Model-specific status filtering
- ✅ Date-based campaign filtering
- ✅ Multi-scope combinations
- ✅ Relationship scope inheritance
- ✅ Local scope integration

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Data Consistency**: All queries automatically filter inactive/unpublished content
2. **Security**: Prevents accidental exposure of inactive content
3. **Performance**: Reduces need for manual filters in every query
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized filtering logic
5. **Developer Experience**: Automatic filtering with easy bypass options
6. **Business Logic**: Enforces business rules at the model level

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Usage:
```php
// Automatic filtering applied
$products = Product::all(); // Only active, published, visible products
$campaigns = Campaign::all(); // Only active campaigns within date range
$orders = Order::all(); // Only orders with allowed statuses
```

#### Bypassing Scopes:
```php
// Get all records including inactive ones
$allProducts = Product::withoutGlobalScopes()->get();
$allCampaigns = Campaign::withoutGlobalScope(ActiveCampaignScope::class)->get();
```

#### Combining with Local Scopes:
```php
// Global scopes work seamlessly with local scopes
$featuredProducts = Product::featured()->get(); // Active, published, visible, AND featured
$recentCampaigns = Campaign::recent(30)->get(); // Active, within date range, AND recent
```

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `app/Models/Scopes/StatusScope.php`
- `app/Models/Scopes/ActiveCampaignScope.php`
- `tests/Feature/AdditionalGlobalScopesTest.php`
- `GLOBAL_SCOPES_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

### Modified Files:
- `app/Models/Partner.php` - Added ActiveScope, EnabledScope
- `app/Models/Campaign.php` - Added ActiveScope, StatusScope, ActiveCampaignScope
- `app/Models/Attribute.php` - Added ActiveScope, EnabledScope, VisibleScope
- `app/Models/Order.php` - Added ActiveScope, StatusScope
- `app/Models/Channel.php` - Added ActiveScope, EnabledScope, StatusScope
- `app/Models/Zone.php` - Added ActiveScope, EnabledScope, StatusScope
- `app/Models/Scopes/README.md` - Updated documentation

## Verification

All global scopes have been tested and verified to work correctly:
- ✅ Scope classes load without errors
- ✅ Models apply scopes automatically
- ✅ Scopes can be bypassed when needed
- ✅ No linting errors detected
- ✅ Follows Laravel 11 best practices

## Conclusion

The global scopes implementation is now comprehensive and production-ready, covering 18 models with 7 different scope types. This ensures consistent, secure, and performant data filtering across the entire e-commerce application, following the Laravel News article pattern exactly as requested.
