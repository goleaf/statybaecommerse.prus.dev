## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### üî• P0 - System Blockers
1. **Admin Login Failure (CRITICAL)**
   - Issue: Admin login returns 404/500 errors
   - Impact: Blocks all admin functionality testing
   - Action: Verify Filament panel registration, clear caches, test routes

2. **Test Coverage Gap (HIGH)**
   - Current: 15% test coverage (8 test files)
   - Required: 85%+ coverage for production deployment
   - Impact: Insufficient quality assurance for production

3. **2FA Verification (HIGH)**
   - Status: Implementation exists but needs production verification
   - Components: Enrollment, confirmation, recovery flows
   - Impact: Security feature reliability unknown

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **üî• URGENT:** Fix admin login redirect issues
   - Run `php artisan filament:upgrade`
   - Clear all caches: `php artisan optimize:clear`
   - Verify storage links: `php artisan storage:link`
   - Test admin access at `/admin/login`

2. **üìù HIGH PRIORITY:** Implement comprehensive test suite
   - Set up Pest testing framework
   - Create unit tests for all models
   - Implement feature tests for controllers and components
   - Add browser tests for critical e-commerce flows

3. **üîí MEDIUM PRIORITY:** Verify 2FA functionality
   - Test enrollment and confirmation flows
   - Verify recovery code generation
   - Test middleware enforcement on admin routes
   - Document recovery procedures
