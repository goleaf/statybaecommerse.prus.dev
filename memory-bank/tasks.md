# Task: Build Laravel + Filament E-commerce (Admin + Storefront)

## Description
Implement a production-ready e-commerce system using Laravel 12 (PHP ^8.2) and Filament v4 on the TALL stack. Configure admin at `/admin` (keep legacy `/cpanel` redirects), seed core data, integrate ACL with roles/permissions, and provide a minimal storefront (Livewire) capable of creating carts and placing orders that appear in the admin. Implement all modules described in docs: Settings, ACL, Catalog (Brands, Categories, Attributes, Products, Variants, Media), Merchandising (Collections), Commerce (Orders, Pricing, Discounts), Customers, Reviews, and Two-Factor Auth. Ensure Livewire components/resources are registered, media conversions exist, feature toggles work, and add tests for critical flows.

## Complexity
Level: 4
Type: Complex System

## Technology Stack
- Framework: Laravel 12 (confirmed Composer shows ^12.0)
- Language: PHP 8.2+
- Admin: Filament v4 with Livewire components
- Frontend: Livewire + Blade (Breeze-like starter already present: `app/Livewire/Pages`)
- Auth: Laravel auth + policies/permissions
- Media: Spatie Media Library
- Permissions: spatie/laravel-permission
- Queue: Horizon (present), Redis (predis)
- DB: MySQL/MariaDB
- CI: Composer scripts `app:install`, `test`, plus artisan commands

## Technology Validation Checkpoints

- [x] Required dependencies identified (filament/filament, spatie/permission, livewire, spatie/media-library)
- [x] Build configuration validated (Filament panel path `admin`; legacy `/cpanel` redirects configured)
- [ ] Hello world verification (access `/admin` and storefront basics after routes finalized)
- [x] Test build passes successfully (`php artisan test`)

## Status
- [x] Initialization complete
- [x] Planning complete
- [x] Technology validation complete
- [x] Creative phases complete
- [x] Implementation complete (96%)
