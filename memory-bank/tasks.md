# Task: Build Laravel + Filament E-commerce (Admin + Storefront)

## Description
Implement a production-ready e-commerce system using Laravel 12 (PHP ^8.2) and Filament v4 on the TALL stack. Configure admin at `/admin` (keep legacy `/cpanel` redirects), seed core data, integrate ACL with roles/permissions, and provide a minimal storefront (Livewire) capable of creating carts and placing orders that appear in the admin. Implement all modules described in docs: Settings, ACL, Catalog (Brands, Categories, Attributes, Products, Variants, Media), Merchandising (Collections), Commerce (Orders, Pricing, Discounts), Customers, Reviews, and Two-Factor Auth. Ensure Livewire components/resources are registered, media conversions exist, feature toggles work, and add tests for critical flows.

## Complexity
Level: 4
Type: Complex System

## Technology Stack
- Framework: Laravel 12 (confirmed Composer shows ^12.0)
- Language: PHP 8.2+

- Auth: Laravel auth + policies/permissions
- Media: Spatie Media Library
- Permissions: spatie/laravel-permission
- Queue: Horizon (present), Redis (predis)
- DB: MySQL/MariaDB
